Notes relating to the research into YT Documentries up loaded from NZ

Stack Overflow Question 1

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25173399/using-youtube-api-to-list-documentary-videos-uploaded-from-nz/25184264#25184264

I am helping a researcher wanting to list YouTube videos uploaded from a specific country/region that are a particular genre. In particular, documentary videos uploaded by people from New Zealand. My expectation based on what I have found in Stack Overflow is that the region is more about access to the video rather than the region it was uploaded from but if someone knows a workaround that could return that list via the api that would be great.

Stack Overflow Answer 1-1:
Try Something like this:

http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?max-results=50&location=42.0000,174.0000&location-radius=1000km

This search searches for:

50 Videos
All from New Zealand
Within a 1000KM ratius of the center of it

And For videos over the first 50 just use= http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/videos?max-results=50&start-index=50&location=42.0000,174.0000&location-radius=1000km

And Change the "start-index" to be at increments of 50...

So 50, 100, 150, 200...

But Beware im preatty sure this only works if the author chooses to put a location on their video.
